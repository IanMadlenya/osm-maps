Pandonia is a set of styles used by Flickr for our OSM map tiles. It's based on
[OSM Bright][] and is written in [Carto][]. It's intended to be used with
[TileMill][] and OSM Bright.

Setup
-----

1. Get and install OSM Bright. You can use step 3 of [these instructions](http://mapbox.com/tilemill/docs/guides/osm-bright-mac-quickstart/) if you like.
2. Replace `base.mss`, `labels.mss`, `palette.mss`, and `roads.mss` with the Pandonia versions of those files.
3. Replace the `img` and `res` directories with the Pandonia versions.
4. Open TileMill and enjoy.
